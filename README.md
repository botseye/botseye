I learned Electrical and Automation Engineering, Programming and Mathematics. 
I am experienced with CV, ML, and DL.
Now I am studying Robotics and RL.

Robot, CV and DL are the most words that make me energized every second.
Someday, I want to develop cool robots for Agriculture, medical field and spacecrafts.
